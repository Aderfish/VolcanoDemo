# Volcano Simulation

![A representative image](images/volcano.jpg){width="300px"}


## Abstract
The final objective is to have a scene of a realistic volcano eruption rendered in real time.
The user would be able to play with the simulation parameters in order to get various volcano eruptions.

The scene would consist of the following:
<ul>
<li>A volcano terrain that is proceduraly generated (terrain + texture)</li>
<li>Particles effects to represent the smoke above the crater</li>
<li>A particle simulation of the lava flow that is exiting the crater</li>
<li>A convicing rendering of the lava flow using Vorono誰 tesselation and procedural textures that depend on physical aspects of the lava</li>
</ul>

To achive this goal, we plan on doing the following:

We will generate the volcano terrain and texture procedurally using the techniques that we have worked on during the homework on Perlin noise.

Then, we will implement a particle system to generate the smoke that is leaving from the volcano crater.

We will create a simulation of the lava flowing from the volcano. To do so, we are going to perform a fluid simulation using a paricle system to represent the lava. In particular, we'll base our implementation mainly on the paper [Animating Lava Flows](http://www-evasion.imag.fr/Publications/1999/SACNG99/gi99.pdf) that describes an efficient approach to animate lava flows.

Then, we have to create a convicing rendering of the lava flow particle system. To do so, the first thing to do is to generate an appropriate mesh to represent the shape of the lava particles systems. This can be achieved using a method called Vorono誰 tesselation. To implement it, we'll use the approach proposed in [Voronoi cell analysis: The shapes of particle systems](https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article/90/6/469/2820132/Voronoi-cell-analysis-The-shapes-of-particle).

Finally, we need to bring texture to our lava flow for it to be convicing. To do so, we'll use an approach that is partially based on physical aspects of the lava and also based on a procedural approach. Conretelly, the plan is to use the temperature a lava point to get it's "orangeness". Then, on top of that we add a procedural texture to get a good render with crusts.

To finish, we plan on making the flow simulation parameters changeable by the user. This way, we can observe various kind of eruptions. Then, we'll proceed on recording a video of an eruption rendered through this project to showcase during the final presentation.
