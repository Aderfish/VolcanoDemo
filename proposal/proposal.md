# Volcano Simulation

![A representative image](images/volcano.jpg){width="300px"}


## Abstract
The final objective is to have a scene of a realistic volcano eruption rendered in real time.
The user would be able to play with the simulation parameters in order to get various volcano eruptions.

The scene would consist of the following:
<ul>
<li>A volcano terrain that is proceduraly generated (terrain + texture)</li>
<li>Particles effects to represent the smoke above the crater</li>
<li>A particle simulation of the lava flow that is exiting the crater</li>
<li>A convicing rendering of the lava flow using Voronoï tesselation and procedural textures that depend on physical aspects of the lava</li>
</ul>

| Physical based lava rendering              | 20           | 15             |
| Procedural volcano terrain generation              | 5           | 5             |
| Procedural texture generation              | 10           | 10             |
