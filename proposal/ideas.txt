volcano scene

procedural textures (for lava and rocks) (10 points)
procedural generation of terrain (5 points)
smoke and projection particles effects (20 points)
fluid simulation of lava flowing down (20 points)

physical shader for lava (15 points) 

// bezier curves for camera movement through the scene (10 points)


rendering
-> particles + physical based

procedural
-> terrain + textures

geometric modelling
-> fluid simulation
