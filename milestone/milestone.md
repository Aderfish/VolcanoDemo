# Volcano


## Progress Summary

1. So far, we have started by creating a framework that will allow us to efficiently add features to our project. Then, we designed an algorithm using perlin noise to create the heightmap of a volcano on a island. And we have integrated a UI menu that allows to set the generation parameters in live (17 different parameters in total). \
In parallel, we have worked on generating a procedural texture for the volcano in order to get a more realistic look. \
We have also worked on the smoke particles coming out of the volcano crater. \
Finally, we have started working on the simulation of the lava flow following the process described in the paper [Animating lava flows](http://www-evasion.imag.fr/Publications/1999/SACNG99/gi99.pdf).

2. Show some preliminary results.

3. Optionally present the validation of any feature you have already implemented. This is not mandatory, but it can help you get useful feedback for the final report.

	- Feature Name

		- Implementation

			Briefly describe how you implemented the feature.

		- Validation

			Provide evidence (plots, screenshots, animations, etc.) that the feature works as expected.


4. Report the number of hours each team member has dedicated to the project (as recorded on Moodle). Comment on the accuracy of your initial time estimates. Critically reflect on your work plan and assess if you are on track.

## Schedule Update

1. Acknowledge any delays or unexpected issues, and motivate proposed changes to the schedule, if needed.
