## Volcano simulation


### Global usage

- Set your simulation parameters under the file `src/examples/example_1`. (All the parameters meaning are fully detailled in `src/lava/simulation/sim_parameters.js`)
- Open the demo in a browser
- Open the developper console
- Bake the simulation by pressing the key `b` (You should then se in the console the progress of the baking, it might take about 30min to an hour depending on the hardware and simulation)
- Once baking done, press `p` to play the simulation



### Controls

#### Camera
- You can alternate between a gimbal mode and a FPV by pressing the key `g`.
- In FPV, you can move using the keys `z,q,s,d` and rotate the camera with `a,e`. You can also turn the camera holding the left mouse button pressed. You can adjust your speed using the keys `o` (faster) and `l` (slower).

### Simulation
- You can launch the simulation baking by pressing `b` (it is advised to open the console first to see the progress).
- Once baked, you can play the simulation by pressing `p`. Pressing `p` again will pause the simulation.
- At any point, you can replay the baked simulation by pressing the key `r`.
